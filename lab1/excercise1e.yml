# 1e. Create a YAML file that is a nested data structure. The highest level data
# structure should be a dictionary with a key-name of "network_devices". The value
# corresponding to this key should be a two-element list. Each element of this
# list should contain a dictionary with six key-value pairs (host, username, password,
# device_type, use_session_log, ip_addresses). The ip_addresses key should point to
# a list of IP addresses that each network device contains (just make up three IP
# addresses for each device).

# Once again, use the python "print_yaml.py" script to print the contents of the YAML file to stdout.
