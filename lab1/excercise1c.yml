#1c. Create a YAML file that contains a dictionary representing a networking device 
#(in an expanded YAML format). The highest level key should be the device name
# (for example, "rtr1"). The value corresponding to that key should be another
# dictionary. This inner dictionary should have the following key-value pairs
# (host, username, password, device_type, use_session_log). use_session_log should
# be a YAML-boolean, the rest of the values should be strings. Use the "print_yaml.py" 
# python script to print the contents of the YAmL file to stdout.

rtr1:
  host: cisco1.lasthop.io
  username: pyclass
  password: somepass
  device_type: cisco_ios
  use_session_log: false
